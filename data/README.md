This is a voxel engine me and SomeRandomGpu are working on. 
It's inspired by minecraft but it's gonna be completely free and open source. 
While it's a survival game at the same time it's a game engine. 
The game is written in odin, all the depedencies are in. You only need to setup odin, compile and everything should work out of the box.
If you want to contribute contact me on discord, my nickname is radio_dwarf. 
We are looking for a structure designer and a 2d pixel artist who is experienced with creating textures.
